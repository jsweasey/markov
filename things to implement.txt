add new weightings to create different relationships between pair words, e.g. higher weight to short words.

add method to catagorize each word/character and allow for weighting so that certatin sequences that make more sense occur e.g. noun, verb, punctuation

structure generator of the catagories needed (include discount factor to stop long chaining), then fill in with word pairs that fit the structure

add context (e.g. string to work from), use uniqueness of words to determine important words and change probability of certain words based off of the context
